## Writeup

You will then spend no more than 2-3 pages writing up your project. You should
describe your research question, then discuss the approach you took and the coding involved, including discussing any weaknesses or difficulties encountered. Finish with a brief discussion of results, and how this could be fleshed out in future research. The primary purpose of this writeup is to inform me of what I am reading before I look at your code
