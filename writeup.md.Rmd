# Introduction (Motivation and Research Question)
This is the writeup summarizing the final project for Data and Programming for Public Policy II - R Programming. The research is motivated by the global issue and development programs; Persistent poverty in Low-income countries and trends of finance-focused poverty alleviation programs. Despite a global decline in poverty rates over recent 20 years, low-income countries have remained nearly stagnant, trapped into poverty where over 50% of the population continues to struggle for less than $2.15 per day (World Bank. (2024). Poverty and Inequality Platform. World Bank Group. https://pip.worldbank.org/). To address this poverty issue, one of the most popular poverty alleviation program is microfinance, targetting minorities who are inaccessible to financial services and provide complements. This raised curiosity about how financial accessibility can improve poverty such that the research question below is suggested:
How and what type of financial inclusion for the poor is correlated with poverty levels across countries?

# Data Source
The research involves five data sources:

1. World Bank Global Findex Database 2021: 4 financial inclusion indicators (account, saving, borrowing, and digital payment) for income, poorest 40% (% ages 15+) across countries in 2014, 2017, and 2021 (directly downloaded its .xlsx from the world bank homepage: https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex/Data, choosing country-level .xlsx file.)

2. World Development Indicators: Poverty headcount ratio (%) (used the package ‚ÄúWDI‚Äù in R)

3. IMF Real GDP Growth (retrieved from the API as the .json version from IMF DataMapper API documentation: https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/api/v1/NGDP_RPCH)

4. Natural Earth: world choropleth map (directly downloaded its .zip file, including the shape version from the natural earth homepage: https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/, choosing Admin o - Countries (version 5.1.1))

5. CAN MICROFINANCE UNLOCK A POVERTY TRAP FOR SOME ENTREPRENEURS?: The research paper (directly downloaded its pdf file from the NATIONAL BUREAU of ECONOMIC RESEARCH homepage: https://www.nber.org/papers/w26346)

# Methodology
This study employs a quantitative, correlational research method with panel data mainly sourced from World Bank. It is hypothesized that there is a negative correlation between financial inclusion percentages for the poor and poverty headcount ratio. Due to year variation across countries, the analysis uses panel data across 47 countries among a total of 89 countries, which have all years (2014, 2017 , and 2021) data. A Fixed-Effects panel regression model controls unobserved time-invariant characteristics at the country level, with clustered standard errors to account for correlation within countries over time. This design enables to apply fixed-effect for a balanced panel, which provides robust insights into the temporal relationships between financial inclusion variables and poverty across years and controls for country-level unobserved heterogenity. However, as the sample size was reduced, it potentially limits the generalizability of results.

# Research Design
rty levels across countries with complete data for 2014, 2017, and 2021?
Research Objectives
To examine the correlation between financial inclusion variables and poverty levels.
To control for economic factors like GDP and assess their moderating effect on poverty.
To evaluate temporal changes in the relationship between financial inclusion and poverty over the three years.
Key Variables
Dependent Variable:
Poverty Level: poverty_headcount_ratio
Independent Variables (Financial Inclusion):
per_account_ownership_poor: Percentage of poor individuals with a financial account.
per_saving_poor: Percentage of poor individuals saving in financial institutions.
per_borrowing_poor: Percentage of poor individuals borrowing from financial institutions.
per_digital_payment_poor: Percentage of poor individuals making digital payments.
Control Variables:
Economic Growth: gdp (log-transformed for better interpretation).
Empirical Strategy
Model Specification:
Use a fixed-effects (FE) panel regression model to control for unobserved, time-invariant country-specific characteristics (e.g., geography, culture).
Where:

$$
\text{Poverty\_Headcount\_Ratio}_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\text{Account\_Ownership}_{it}) + \beta_2(\text{Savings}_{it}) + \beta_3(\text{Borrowing}_{it}) + \beta_4(\text{Digital\_Payments}_{it}) + \beta_5(\text{GDP}_{it}) + \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{it}
$$

Implementation:


1. Overall Model Insights
Dependent Variable: Poverty Headcount Ratio (poverty rate).

Independent Variables:

Financial inclusion indicators: account ownership, savings, borrowing, digital payments.
Economic growth variable: Real GDP Growth.
Observations: A total of 141 data points.

R¬≤ (Explained Variance):

The model explains 17.2% of the variance in poverty rates.
Adjusted R¬≤ is negative (-0.302), indicating the model struggles to explain the data when accounting for the number of predictors.
Conclusion: The model has low explanatory power, suggesting limitations in variable selection or data structure.
F-Statistic: 3.703*** (p < 0.01):

The overall model is statistically significant, indicating that at least one independent variable is related to the dependent variable.
2. Interpretation of Individual Variables
(a) Account Ownership (Income, poorest 40%)
Coefficient: 0.505
Standard Error: (3.344)
p-value: Not significant.
Interpretation:
Account ownership for the poorest 40% shows a positive relationship with poverty rates (poverty increases as account ownership rises), but the result is not statistically significant.
No robust conclusion can be drawn about the effect of account ownership on poverty.
(b) Savings (Income, poorest 40%)

Coefficient: 0.757
Standard Error: (1.200)
p-value: Not significant.
Interpretation:
Savings behavior shows a small positive relationship with poverty rates, but this result is not statistically significant.
Savings activity does not have a clear impact on reducing poverty in this dataset.
(c) Borrowing (Income, poorest 40%)
Coefficient: 3.524*
Standard Error: (1.807)
p-value: *p < 0.1 (significant).
Interpretation:
Borrowing is positively and significantly associated with poverty rates, suggesting that an increase in borrowing correlates with an increase in poverty.
This could indicate that borrowing is not being used effectively or that it leads to higher debt burdens among the poorest populations.
(d) Digital Payments (Income, poorest 40%)
Coefficient: -3.146
Standard Error: (2.595)
p-value: Not significant.
Interpretation:
Digital payment use shows a weak negative relationship with poverty rates (poverty decreases as digital payments rise), but the result is not statistically significant.
The impact of digital payments on poverty reduction is unclear.
(e) Real GDP Growth
Coefficient: -0.004
Standard Error: (0.034)
p-value: Not significant.
Interpretation:
Economic growth shows virtually no relationship with poverty rates and is statistically insignificant.
This suggests that economic growth alone is insufficient to address poverty in the studied context.
3. Key Conclusions
Significant Variable:

Borrowing behavior (Borrowing (Income, poorest 40%)) is significantly associated with poverty increases, indicating potential issues with debt management among the poorest groups.
Non-significant Variables:

Other financial inclusion variables (account ownership, savings, digital payments) and GDP growth do not show significant relationships with poverty.
This might reflect data limitations or that these factors have limited direct effects on poverty rates in the studied context.
Model‚Äôs Explanatory Power:

The low R¬≤ value suggests that the model does not sufficiently capture the drivers of poverty. Including additional variables such as education, infrastructure, or social policies could improve explanatory power.
Policy Implications:

Effective borrowing management and financial education programs could help alleviate poverty among the poorest groups.
Other financial inclusion activities might need complementary policies to be impactful.
